### 🌟 Achievements
> What made me proud today?
> I did all the creating states and handling states by myself and i am confident in it
### 📈 Growth
> How did I improve?
> I didnt need help from any source for most of the part and was able to write stuff on own
### 🎯 Areas for Improvement
> What could be better?
> I could focus more on the syntax stuff and learn fetching stuff
### 🌱 Personal Notes
> Additional thoughts or feelings about the day
 I feel good

## 📝 Development Log

#### List the specific tasks, features, or problems you solved today

- [x] **Refactored Components:** Moved state and data-fetching logic from `JournalFeed` to `App.jsx`
- [x] **Implemented Prop Drilling:** Passed state (`entries`) and callback functions (`handleEntryAdded`) from parent to child components.
- [x] **Installed & Configured React Router:** Set up a multi-page structure with routes for `/` and `/auth`.
- [x] **Created `AuthContext`:** Built a global provider to manage the JWT and user session, persisting the token to `localStorage`.
- [x] **Built `AuthPage` UI:** Implemented a complete, functional form for both Login and Registration that connects to the `AuthContext`.


## 💡 Learning & Insights

<details open>
<summary>Knowledge Gained</summary>

### 🔬 Technical Discoveries

| Technology | Learning | Confidence |
|:--|:--|:--|
| React State | "Lifting State Up" is the core pattern for sharing data between sibling components; the parent must own the state. | 🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔸🔸 80% |
| Context API| The standard for avoiding "prop drilling" with global data like authentication tokens. | 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💚💚💚 70% |
| React Router | The useNavigate hook is the primary tool for programmatic redirection after events like a successful login. | 🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔸 90% |

### 🌟 Best Practices

> 💡 **Key Insight**: The parent component should be the "source of truth." Data flows down via props; events flow up via callback functions.
>
> **Why it matters**: This unidirectional data flow makes React applications predictable, easier to debug, and simpler to reason about as they grow in complexity.

<summary>Problems & Resolutions</summary>

### 🎯 Technical Challenges

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Challenge: Frontend API calls failing] --> B{Investigation};
    B --> C[Check Network Tab];
    C --> D[Root Cause: Fetching from wrong port (`:5173`)];
    D --> E[Solution: Namespace all API routes with `/api`];
    E --> F[Outcome: Vite proxy correctly forwards requests];
```

### 💭 Lessons Learned

> 📝 **Key Takeaway**: When frontend and backend are on different ports, proxy configuration is critical. API requests must match the proxy path exactly.
>
> **Future Prevention**: Establish a clear API namespacing convention (`/api/v1/...`) at the start of any new project.

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan

*What will you focus on tomorrow?*

- [ ] Implement the `ProtectedRoute` component to prevent unauthenticated access.
- [ ] Refactor all components to consume the global `AuthContext` instead of using hardcoded tokens.
- [ ] Complete the full CRUD functionality by connecting the "Delete" and "Create" UI actions to the backend API via the global context.
