# üìÖ Daily Log - 29-08-2025

## üéØ Today's Focus

*So for the last few weeks, I have been unable to learn or log anything in this diary, because of you know stuff in life, but anyways today I was able to finish few things in the project that I have been working on.
Today's task was to make the journal entries get displayed in the front end by fetching them from database
*


## ‚úÖ What I Accomplished

*Today I was able to connect front end to backend and adding the method to fetch the journal entries of the user through `GET methods`*

- [x] Lifting state up 
- [x] Add functionaltiy to fetch the entries fro backend


## üß† What I Learned

*Backend stuff: how to fetch data from server, lifting state in react*

### Technical Learnings

- **Props (Passing Data Down)**: Refactored the `JournalFeed` component to be a "presentational" component, receiving the `entries` array as a prop from its parent (`App.jsx`).
- **Props (Passing Functions Up)**:  Implemented a callback function (`handleEntryAdded`) in the parent component (`App.jsx`) and passed it down as a prop to the child (`JournalForm.jsx`). This allows the child to trigger a state update in the parent.
- **Lifting State Up**: Executed the core React architectural pattern of moving state from a child component (`JournalFeed`) to the lowest common ancestor (`App.jsx`). This was done to share state between sibling components (`JournalFeed` and `JournalForm`).
- **Full-Stack CRUD (Create & Read)**:Connected the frontend form to the backend `POST` endpoint to create new data. Implemented the full data loop where a new entry created in the `JournalForm` is added to the parent's state, which then automatically re-renders the `JournalFeed` to display the new entry instantly.
  
## Key Learning:

- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: "Lifting state up" is the standard React solution for managing shared data. It reinforces React's core principle of a one-way data flow: state flows down from parent to child via props, and events are communicated up from child to parent via callback functions. This makes application logic predictable and easier to debug.
- **Sibling Component Communication**: Sibling components (like our form and feed) do not communicate directly. They must communicate through their parent. The parent component owns the state and provides its children with both the data to display and the functions to change that data.
- **Smart vs. Presentational Components**: We transformed our architecture. The `App` component became a "smart" or "container" component, responsible for managing state and logic. The `JournalFeed` and `JournalForm` components became more "presentational," responsible only for displaying UI and reporting user events.
