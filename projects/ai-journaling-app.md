# üöÄ Project: AI-Powered Journaling App

## üìã Project Overview

*A full-stack MERN web application that allows users to write, store, and manage journal entries securely. The application's standout feature will be AI-powered semantic search, enabling users to find past entries based on conceptual meaning rather than just keywords.*

**Start Date**: 25-08-2025 
**Target End Date**: Yet to decide 
**Status**: In Progress 
**Priority**: High

## üéØ Goals & Objectives
*What do you want to achieve with this project?*

### Primary Goals

- [ ] **Goal 1**:  Develop and deploy a secure, performant, and feature-complete full-stack MERN application.
- [ ] **Goal 2**:  Implement a unique AI-powered semantic search feature to create a standout portfolio piece.
- [ ] **Goal 3**: Master the end-to-end professional developer workflow, from local containerization with Docker to automated cloud deployment with CI/CD.

### Secondary Goals
- [ ] **Goal 1**: Implement a secondary AI feature, such as sentiment analysis for each journal entry.
- [ ] **Goal 2**: Achieve a high level of test coverage for the backend API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features & Requirements

*What functionality will this project have?*

### Core Features

- [ ] **Secure User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out. Passwords must be hashed, and API routes must be protected using JWT.
- [ ] **CRUD for Journal Entries**: Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their own journal entries.
- [ ] **AI Semantic Search**:  An input field that allows users to search their private entries based on the meaning of their query, not just exact keyword matches.

### Nice-to-Have Features

- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis**: Display a sentiment score (e.g., positive, neutral, negative) for each journal entry.
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: A UI toggle for user preference.

### Technical Requirements

- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose), React, Docker, Tailwind CSS, Hugging Face Transformers.js (for embeddings), a Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, MongoDB Atlas Vector Search), and Redis (for caching).
- **Performance**: API response times < 200ms for standard CRUD operations.
- **Security**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit, hashed passwords, JWT-protected routes, environment variables for all secrets.
- **Scalability**: Stateless backend architecture ready for containerized deployment.

## üìÖ Timeline & Milestones

*Break down the project into manageable phases*

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Week 1-3)

- [x] **Milestone**: Secure User Auth API with JWT/bcrypt complete.
- [ ] **Milestone**: Dockerize the backend application and database.
- [ ]  **Milestone**: Finalize all CRUD endpoints for journal entries.

### Phase 2: Frontend Development  (Week 4-6)

- [ ] **Milestone**: Build all UI components with React and Tailwind CSS.
- [ ] **Milestone**: Implement client-side routing and global state management (Context API).
- [ ] **Milestone**: Connect the frontend to the backend API, achieving full CRUD functionality in the UI.

### Phase 3: AI Feature Integration (Week 7-9)
- [ ] **Milestone**: Set up vector database and create a script to generate embeddings.
- [ ] **Milestone**: Set up vector database and create a script to generate embeddings.
- [ ] **Milestone**: Integrate the AI search feature into the React frontend.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation (Week 10-12)
- [ ] **Milestone**: Deploy the full-stack application to a cloud provider.
- [ ] **Milestone**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
- [ ] **Milestone**: Write a professional README and create a video demo for the portfolio.



## üß† Lessons Learned

*Document insights and learnings throughout the project*

### Technical Learnings

- **Lifting State Up**: The React pattern of moving state to the lowest common ancestor is critical for enabling communication between sibling components.
- **Password Hashing**: Storing plain-text passwords is a critical vulnerability. `bcrypt`  is the standard for one-way hashing of sensitive user credentials before database persistence.



### Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge**: Initial attempts to update React state by mutating variables directly.
- **Solution**: Understanding that the only way to trigger a re-render is by calling the state setter function (e.g., `setState()`).
